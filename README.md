# or just run
sniffy
```

### AWS Configuration

Ensure your AWS credentials are configured with the necessary permissions:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:ListSecrets",
                "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret",
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
                "secretsmanager:ListSecretVersionIds",
                "secretsmanager:DeleteSecret"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## üéÆ Usage

### Main Interface

After launching, Sniffy Scan will automatically connect to AWS and scan for potentially unused secrets (not accessed in 14+ days).

### Navigation

#### Results View
- **‚Üë/‚Üì or j/k** - Navigate through secrets
- **Space** - Select/deselect secrets for deletion
- **Enter** - View secret versions and details
- **y** - Copy secret name to clipboard
- **/** - Filter secrets (include matching)
- **?** - Filter secrets (exclude matching)
- **Shift+D** - Delete selected secrets (with confirmation)
- **r** - Rescan for unused secrets only
- **R** - Rescan all secrets
- **esc** - Clear current filter
- **q** - Quit application

#### Secret Details View
- **‚Üë/‚Üì** - Navigate through versions
- **r** - Reveal secret value for selected version
- **y** - Copy secret name to clipboard
- **esc** - Return to main results
- **q** - Quit application

#### Filter Mode
- **Type** - Enter search terms for fuzzy matching
- **Enter** - Apply filter
- **esc** - Cancel filter

### Filtering Examples

```bash
# Include secrets containing "prod"
/ ‚Üí prod ‚Üí Enter

# Exclude secrets containing "test"
? ‚Üí test ‚Üí Enter

# Clear any active filter
esc
```

## üîß Configuration

### Scan Threshold

By default, secrets not accessed in 14+ days are considered "potentially unused". You can modify this in the code:

```go
const recentThresholdDays = 14  // Change this value
```

### Theme Customization

The Tokyo Night theme colors can be customized in the color definitions:

```go
var (
    bgColor     = lipgloss.Color("#1a1b26")
    fgColor     = lipgloss.Color("#a9b1d6")
    blueColor   = lipgloss.Color("#7aa2f7")
    purpleColor = lipgloss.Color("#bb9af7")
    greenColor  = lipgloss.Color("#9ece6a")
    redColor    = lipgloss.Color("#f7768e")
    yellowColor = lipgloss.Color("#e0af68")
    dimColor    = lipgloss.Color("#565f89")
)
```

## üìã Features in Detail

### Secret Analysis
- Fetches all secrets from AWS Secrets Manager
- Filters out configuration secrets (ending in "-configuration")
- Calculates days since last access
- Identifies potentially unused secrets based on configurable threshold

### Interactive Selection
- Multi-select interface with checkboxes
- Visual feedback for selected items
- Bulk operations on selected secrets

### Version Management
- View all versions of a secret
- See creation dates, stages, and access history
- Reveal secret values on demand

### Safe Deletion
- Confirmation prompts before deletion
- Clear error reporting if deletions fail
- Automatic refresh after successful deletions

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- **Read-only by default** - Scanning operations don't modify anything
- **Explicit confirmation** - Deletion requires explicit user confirmation
- **No credential storage** - Uses standard AWS credential chain
- **Minimal permissions** - Only requests necessary AWS permissions
- **Secure clipboard** - Secret values are only copied when explicitly requested

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to initialize AWS connection"**
- Ensure AWS credentials are configured
- Check your AWS region settings
- Verify IAM permissions for Secrets Manager

**"No secrets found"**
- Check if you have secrets in the current AWS region
- Verify your AWS account has access to Secrets Manager
- Ensure your credentials have list permissions

**Cursor positioning issues**
- This is a known issue with the table component
- The functionality works correctly despite visual cursor jumping

### Debug Mode

For detailed error information, you can add debug output by modifying the error handling sections in the code.

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Creating Releases

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. To create a new release:

1. Create and push a new tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. The GitHub Action will automatically:
   - Build binaries for all supported platforms
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Upload all binaries as release assets

### Supported Platforms

| OS      | Architecture | Binary Name                  |
|---------|-------------|------------------------------|
| Linux   | AMD64       | `sniffy-linux-amd64`        |
| Linux   | ARM64       | `sniffy-linux-arm64`        |
| macOS   | AMD64       | `sniffy-darwin-amd64`       |
| macOS   | ARM64       | `sniffy-darwin-arm64`       |

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/willfish/sniffy
cd sniffy

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Run in development mode
go run main.go

# Build for current platform
go build -o sniffy

# Build for all supported platforms (requires goreleaser or manual builds)
make build-all
```

### Release Builds

The project uses automated releases that build for multiple platforms:

- **Linux**: AMD64, ARM64
- **macOS**: AMD64 (Intel), ARM64 (Apple Silicon)  

Binaries are automatically built and uploaded to GitHub Releases using the naming convention:
`sniffy-{os}-{arch}`
